# Mission // #001
## Bug-Hunt

After answering the PCsâ€™ questions, Patience gets down to
the task at hand and briefs them on their first mission. They
give the PCs a choice of two vital tasks.

# Goals
- Stabilize the situation around Evergreen.
- Track the raiders, figure out who they are.
  - Stop their attacks.

# Stakes
- Time is critical. Not acting will result in Evergreen losing contact with surrounding farmland, crippling any kind of expansion.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
