## Rallying Cry

# BRIEFING
Dthall is brief and straightforward: she doesn’t believe that Hivehome or Evergreen will survive alone. Now that she’s certain Evergreen isn’t on the side of the Machine and all the blood has been shed over a misunderstanding, she’s more convinced than ever that uniting the disparate communities and making amends is the only possible way to victory. 

In a few days, the leaders of the HUC are going to have a meeting to decide how to proceed with the war against the Machine. The PCs will be present for this meeting as representatives of Evergreen.

# Goals
- Convince the city-states of the HUC to rally under one banner, come to the aid of Evergreen, and continue the war against the Machine.

# Stakes
- If the HUC is not convinced to aid Evergreen, the Hercynians won’t come to Evergreen’s aid later without some extra effort.

# Reserves
- None
