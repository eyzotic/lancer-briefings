Kalatha is a tall bronze skinned man with short curly black hair, and looks approximately 20u standard. He has dark brown eyes which are framed by symmetrical gold markings on his upper cheeks. When not in his hard suit Kalatha normally wears simple black pants, a pair of worn Karrakin military combat boots, and a t-shirt topped with a multicolored quilted jacket.

Kalatha joined MSMC more to travel across the galaxy than to earn money. With prior military experience he was recruited and completed training and with only two prior deployments (both alongside MSMC SPECTRE) was sent to Hercynia as reinforcements for Squad-EYZ.
