Aster is a mid-20's spacer, originally born into a nuclear family as a second born, preceded by his older sister. With no real expectations placed on him by his otherwise busy, working-class family, he had no direction or aspiration in his youth. His sister was his only friend growing up, and she was only so wise to the world around her herself. He would later be orphaned unfortunately by a series of mysterious circumstances.
